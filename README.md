In this folder, you'll find my first Windows Forms App. It does the following:
- Includes 3 different controls from the .NET framework
- These controls are the Label, TextBox, and Button
- When the button is clicked, a function displays the previously hidden text below the button.
- If the user types in their name and clicks the button, the "name" variable is changed, thus changing the display text.
